## üìñ Overview

This is the official repository for my personal portfolio website. This project is more than just a digital resume; it's a full-stack application designed to showcase my skills in both frontend and backend development. Built as a dynamic Single Page Application (SPA), it features a modern, interactive user interface with complex animations and a custom-built backend to handle real-world functionalities like a contact form.

The entire application, including the backend API, is deployed seamlessly on Vercel, demonstrating a modern, integrated approach to web development.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

This portfolio is packed with features that demonstrate a wide range of technical skills:

* **Dynamic & Interactive UI:**
    * **Particle Background:** An animated, interactive particle background built with `tsParticles` that responds to mouse movement.
    * **Custom Mouse Trail:** A subtle glowing trail follows the user's cursor, enhancing the user experience.
    * **Complex CSS Animations:** Implemented various custom animations (`@keyframes`) for buttons and UI elements to create a "living" interface.
    * **Smooth Transitions:** Utilizes CSS transitions for seamless show/hide effects on project galleries and the mobile navigation menu.

* **Custom Backend API:**
    * Built a custom, server-side API using **Vercel Serverless Functions** (Node.js environment) to handle incoming data from the contact form.
    * The API validates incoming data and orchestrates a multi-step process: saving to a database and triggering an email notification.

* **Full-Stack Functionality:**
    * **Database Integration:** Successfully connected to a **MongoDB Atlas** database, implementing a Mongoose schema to store contact form messages persistently.
    * **Third-Party API Integration:** Integrated the **Resend API** for reliable, automated email notifications, sending a message to my personal inbox whenever a new contact form is submitted.

* **Responsive Design:**
    * Fully responsive layout built with Tailwind CSS, ensuring a great user experience on all devices, from mobile phones to desktop screens.
